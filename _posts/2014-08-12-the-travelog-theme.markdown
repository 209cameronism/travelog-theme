Travelog is a totally rad theme for Jekyll that is both elegant and downright simple. 

Like a backpack with too many straps, I get frustrated when a blog has too many bells and whistles. It is with that philosophy that I have put together this theme so that you might drown in its whitespace.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/885x500" />
    <p class="post-image-caption">Using a little bit of markup, you can add beautiful captions to your totally beautiful pictures. Amazing.</p>
</div>

If you'd like to see it in action, you can do so [here](https://travelog-theme.github.io/). The code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/rowanoulton/travelog-theme).
